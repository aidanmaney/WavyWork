# Mission Statement

WavyWork is a personal productivity tracker and task management tool designed for minimal friction logging and group accountability. As students, we tried every way to stay on top of our work and to stay conscious of how we feel during our efforts. The minimal interface creates a low-stakes, low-stress environment to keep users engaged day after day. Through gentle reminders, we encourage users to review their contributions, cultivating mindfulness and forming helpful habits day after day.

# Notes
- We weren't able to deploy to Google AppEngine because in our groups table, we have a field that has lists. We did not know that we needed to convert these tables into MySQL, and MySQL does not have list functionality. Fixing this would have taken too much developmental time and we decided to focus more on functionality.
